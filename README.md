# EnhancerMatcher
An updated approach to our EnhancerTracker Tool

## Files:
Models: This folder contains the network models used by EnhancerMatcher. The conv_model is used for enhancer predictions, while both cam_model and class_model are used to generate class activation maps.

Output: This folder stores the outputs generated by EnhancerMatcher, including enhancer predictions and class activation maps.

Test_Input: This folder contains test input files for EnhancerMatcher. These files demonstrate the required input format and can be used to test if the tool is functioning correctly. input1.fasta contains the two enhancers that are active in the same cell type in FASTA format. input2.fasta contains a list of sequences in FASTA format that will be evaluated by EnhancerMatcher.

EnhancerMatcher.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code to run EnhancerMatcher. If you are comfortable using Jupyter notebooks, you can modify the parameters in the first few cells and execute the notebook to generate an output evaluation from EnhancerMatcher.

## Tool:
EnhancerMatcher.py: This python code contains the code to run EnhancerTracker. This code is to be executed via terminal, it takes two inputs of fasta files along with a input for whether the user wants class activation maps generated.

## Requirements:
EnhancerTracker uses several libraries:

Python version: 3.10.13 (main, Sep 11 2023, 13:44:35) [GCC 11.2.0]

TensorFlow version: 2.13.0

Biopython version: 1.83

NumPy version: 1.24.3

Matplotlib version: 3.8.3

NOTE: These are the version the program was created on, future versions of these libraries may or may not work.

## To Run Tool:
1. Clone EnhancerMatcher and head to where it was cloned.

2. Make sure EnhancerMatcher is unzipped.

3. Run EnhancerMatcher.py
   > EnhancerMatcher.py two_similar_enhancers.fa sequences.fa

4. In the output folder, the output file is called Model_Output.txt
  Inside contains the given sequence and the percentage of similarity to the first two similar enhancers.

5. If you want a CAM model generated for the input sequence run:
   > EnhancerMatcher.py two_similar_enhancers.fa sequences.fa --cam
