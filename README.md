# EnhancerTracker-2.0
An updated approach to our EnhancerTracker Tool

## Files:
Models: This folder contains the network models used by EnhancerTracker. The conv_model is used for enhancer predictions, while both cam_model and class_model are used to generate class activation maps.

Output: This folder stores the outputs generated by EnhancerTracker, including enhancer predictions and class activation maps.

Test_Input: This folder contains test input files for EnhancerTracker. These files demonstrate the required input format and can be used to test if the tool is functioning correctly. input1.fasta contains the two enhancers that are active in the same cell type in FASTA format. input2.fasta contains a list of sequences in FASTA format that will be evaluated by EnhancerTracker.

EnhancerTracker.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code to run EnhancerTracker. If you are comfortable using Jupyter notebooks, you can modify the parameters in the first few cells and execute the notebook to generate an output evaluation from EnhancerTracker.

EnhancerTracker.py: This python code containts the code to run EnhancerTracker. This code is to be executed via terminal, it takes two inputs of fasta files along with a input for whether the user wants class activation maps generated.

## Tool:

## Requirements:
EnhancerTracker uses several libraries:
